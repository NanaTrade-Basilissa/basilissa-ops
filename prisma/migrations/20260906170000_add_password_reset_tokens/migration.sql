-- Single-use links for setting a forgotten password.
--
-- Only the SHA-256 of the token is stored. The token itself exists in the
-- email and nowhere else, so a database dump does not hand over working reset
-- links — the same reasoning as password hashes, for a credential that is
-- briefly just as good as one.
--
-- ON DELETE CASCADE: a deleted user's outstanding links must not outlive them.
